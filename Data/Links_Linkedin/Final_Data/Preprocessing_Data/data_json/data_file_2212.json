I achieve this by testing different catalysts in a liquid phase reactor, processing kinetic data, and applying different catalyst characterization techniques such as FTIR, TGA, BET, XRD, UV-VIS, and TEM to relate their structure, synthesis process, and properties. I also designed, constructed, and prepared the process instrument diagram (P&ID) of the photocatalytic reactor. This experience as a graduate research assistant has allowed me to achieve strong time management skills that enable on-time project delivery. I have been able to multitask and prioritize my responsibilities, and also to work in teams and collaborate effectively.","title":"Graduate Research Assistant","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":1681513,"name":"Quest Consultants Inc","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFpkEs__m1MsQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1564517211019?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=GvtzNBG0JIJ4-NHHkaH0mcNcJjzIP7jQJbaTPXb2Zcs","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/quest-consultants-inc/","employees":{"start":11,"end":50}},"date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2015}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Norman, OK","date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2015}},"company":"Quest Consultants Inc","description":"During my internship at Quest Consultants, Inc I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge especially in thermodynamics.
