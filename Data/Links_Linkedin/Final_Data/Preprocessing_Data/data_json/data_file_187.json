I have always chosen jobs that allow me to experiment safely with multiple technologies even if sometimes they are outside of my technical comfort-zone. This philosophy about technology allows me to keep a fresh outlook on the field.\n\nThis experimentation of technology doesn't stop at home. I am very proud of working at home in smart home improvements that require the set of skills I have earned throughout my carreer, but also recurring to things I wouldn't normally do, like electronics or carpentry. In the down times I am a fiction writer, although I do it as a hobby (never have had the chance to publish any story I have written). I am also a metal and videogames enthusiast.\n\nI also speak English, Spanish and French fluently (moving slowly in German). And my social skills allow me to easily understand needs and solve problems (even in multi-cultural or multi-language contexts,  where there might exist many communication problems)\n\nIf you believe that I can be of help to you or your organization, don't hesitate to say \"Hello!\".","premium":false,"skills":"User Interface Design, User Interface Programming, Python, Web Programming, Software Project Management, Project Management, Database Management, Android Development, Test Driven Development, Social Networking, Creative Writing, C#, Java, JavaScript, Git, C/C++, .NET Framework, Spring Framework, Node.js, Subversion","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":8141,"name":"Globant","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQHWB0kBTxn0kA/company-logo_400_400/0/1688411226020?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=KklAIsZLqickYeSqnUjYQXDRWohJHTca_D-pHGgWq-c","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/globant/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogota,D.C., Capital District, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Globant","description":null,"title":"Web UI Developer","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":1258225,"name":"id3 Technologies","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQErfcfc8MoonQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1645110587680?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=AhYrQFKeaPBJUVWTuZtLpdmETgBDNJFy4iKMNofZEFY","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/id3-technologies/","employees":{"start":11,"end":50}},"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020}},"company":"id3 Technologies","description":"Full time employment.
