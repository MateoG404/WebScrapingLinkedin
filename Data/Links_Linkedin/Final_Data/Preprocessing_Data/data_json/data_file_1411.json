I feel strongly motivated for challenges involved with energy technology, also how to improve and optimize the systems for achieving net zero emissions and get involved with the communities in the process of using resources of the environment.\n\nWith a background in Mechanical Engineering, I was an engineering intern at the United Nations for Industrial Development (UNIDO) in Colombia. The Industrial Energy Efficiency program funded by the Global Environmental Fund (GEF) and executed by UNIDO with the Colombian government was devoted to implementing Energy Management Systems based on the ISO 50001 and tracking their CO2 emissions savings throughout the process. I was focused mainly on reviewing the estimations of the savings of emissions and updated them with the progress of the program, moreover with all activities involved in training, logistics, media and communications with industries.\n\nAfter the chapter as an engineering intern, I joined the french multinational company Veolia in Colombia. I started as an Energy Junior Engineer developing energy audits for hospitals, commercial buildings and Industry. I was identified in the company as a young talent and participated in training for developing technical, economical and manager skills. After a couple of years in the position and learning about not only energy efficiency but business and other technical areas like water and waste, I was promoted to the position of Energy Specialist Engineer, having more responsibilities for leading more complex techno-economical studies of energy efficiency as well as the development of Veolia\u2019s monitor center for operations \u201cHubgrade\u201d focused on energy.\n\nI am passionate about nature, that\u2019s why I am an outdoors explorer and climber, also a general sport fan. This has let me travel whenever I can to mountains and amazing places in different countries. A great part of doing it is to learn about diversity and cultures, different lifestyles and also about myself.I believe that one can try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. \n\nAfter working for more than 4 years I took the decision to study an International double degree Master in Renewable Energy where my first year was at UPC Barcelona. Currently I\u2019m in my second year of the master's program at KTH and I am searching for full time opportunities in the renewable energy sector for the second semester of 2023 . I am open to expanding my professional network, feel free to contact me!","premium":false,"skills":"Prevention, Abuse Prevention, Role Modeling, Social Responsibility, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Teamwork, Challenge Driven, Energy Audits, Product Development, Plastics Industry, Product Quality, Renewable Energy Systems, Renewable Resources, Social Innovation, Gender Equality, Risk Management, Renewable Energy, Data Science, Python (Programming Language), Data Analysis","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":16159022,"name":"Veolia Colombia","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHzwZf8RT3-4g/company-logo_400_400/0/1519868634382?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=vppMTMFqcq1Q7Hl5A84X8nElWRi_Annc45CvTwaLhnk","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/veolia-colombia/","employees":{"start":5001,"end":10000}},"date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2017},"end":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2021}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2021}},"company":"Veolia Colombia","description":"\u2022 Provided Veolia\u2019s Business Units and clients facilities with technical and operational recommendations, best practices, technological recommendations in energy efficiency and sustainability to guarantee the compliance of the operational planning.\n\u2022 Led the development of the energy projects according to procedures established for different stages of management.\n\u2022 Supported the operational performance of Veolia\u2019s Business Units and clients facilities by monitoring the KPI's and the implementation of action plans for improvement of efficiency and environmental goals\n\u2022 Led and elaborated energy efficiency offers for the development of new businesses and analysis of energy performance to optimize the ongoing operations.\n\u2022 Analyzed and followed the energy markets and legislation for improvement on the possible opportunities (financial incentives) and consequences (penalties) in energy projects and operations\n\u2022 Defined, analyzed and monitored the energy performance dashboards ( KPI's) of the facilities connected to Hubgrade using energy management tools (software for implementing the ISO 50001 and IPMVP).\n\u2022 All the previous responsibilities as Energy Project Junior Engineer.","title":"Energy Specialist Project Engineer","employment_type":"Full-time"},{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2017},"end":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2020}},"company":"Veolia Colombia","description":"\u2022 Elaborated and delivered opportunely the energy efficiency technical and economical offers\n\u2022 Carried out technical visits to energy facilities  (with boilers, chillers, compressors, generators, etc.) to analyze data and optimize processes in compliance with energy audits.\n\u2022 Identified energy and economic savings or conservative measures in the facilities visited.\n\u2022 Prepared the economic and technical offers with focus on energy efficiency and sustainability for clients in the established times.\n\u2022 Supported the commercial team presentation of the offers to clients.\n\u2022 Elaborated specific studies for the optimization and improvement in the operation of the business units of Veolia taking into account the International performance measurement and verification protocol (IPMVP) and energy management systems (EnMS ISO 50001).\n\u2022 Analyzed and followed up on the gas, electricity and energy markets.\n\u2022 Communicated and collaborated opportunely with different areas of the organization for the development of the offers.","title":"Energy Junior Project Engineer","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":10168,"name":"UNIDO","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGNDeGafIGY3A/company-logo_400_400/0/1519856146490?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=zX61cY0fcX5OpEX3-9k6IQxSAACrXDqS3mSrMbhvlfI","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/unido/","employees":{"start":1001,"end":5000}},"date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2017}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2017}},"company":"UNIDO","description":"\u2022 Elaborated on the first review on the baseline project (Energy efficiency in Colombian industries -
