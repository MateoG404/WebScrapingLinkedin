Specialised in urban resilience and adaptation of urban infrastructure to climate change, he supports cities on climate and sustainability issues, working on cutting-edge projects, proposals and knowledge products. Juan is a civil engineer with a PhD from the University of Cambridge. Using a multidisciplinary approach, his doctoral thesis analysed the governance structures behind adaptation planning of urban road networks and outlined how these structures can be improved to achieve resilient, safe, and inclusive cities. He has more than 3 years of experience working on sustainability and resilience projects in Colombia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, Tajikistan and Turkey.\n\nApplying his expertise, he currently is the UK's Young Professional Representative at the Climate Change and Resilience of Road Networks Technical Committee from the World Road Association (PIARC). At the committee, he is exploring how to apply the lessons learned through his doctoral research to help develop uniform and holistic methodological approaches to increase the resilience of road infrastructure to climate change and other hazards and update accordingly the PIARC International Climate Change Adaptation Framework for Road Infrastructure. This will benefit the 122 government members of PIARC.","premium":false,"skills":"Civil Engineering, Climate Change Adaptation, Climate Action Planning, Research, Construction, Ingenier\u00eda civil, Investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo, Engineering, Project Management, Risk Management, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, AutoCAD, Microsoft PowerPoint, Group Work, Trabajo en equipo, Teamwork, Interviewing","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":18625,"name":"Foster + Partners","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQGE6YN0bLsqsA/company-logo_400_400/0/1688373565299/foster__partners_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=FpjeNpib6tFE48BpqoLiEw-3Jr6fpUiwfG5yNw_tO1o","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/foster-&-partners/","employees":{"start":1001,"end":5000}},"date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"London, England, United Kingdom","date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Foster + Partners","description":"As a Senior Sustainability Coordinator with a background in quantitative and qualitative project analysis, resilience and sustainability advocacy I lead the development of viable, practical and evidence-based sustainable solutions for our architectural projects.
