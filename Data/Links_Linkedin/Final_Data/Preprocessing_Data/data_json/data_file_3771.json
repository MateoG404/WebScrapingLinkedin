This type of vision has reinforced the independent work and proactive investigation attitude which I developed during my research studies. At the same time, I\u2019ve had to extend my professional network in search of experts which help us take on new and challenging projects.\n\nDuring my PhD, my research focused on modeling material behavior during injection molding of high-performance plastics for the Automotive Industry. This type of research enabled me to work in experimental applications as well as technical aspects of simulation.","premium":false,"skills":"Matlab, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, ANSYS, R&D, COMSOL Multiphysics, Solid Edge, NX Unigraphics, Autodesk Inventor, Microsoft Excel, NI LabVIEW, OpenFOAM, Leadership, Customer Service, Microsoft Office, Management, Project Management, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Microsoft PowerPoint","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":68123110,"name":"SoilNet","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEfvue-3waXyg/company-logo_400_400/0/1592424473532?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=Sa6Etv5cWJoCPi72o82WsmrwRrsDqnaWsQO10PNJNCc","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/soilnetllc/","employees":{"start":11,"end":50}},"date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Belleville, Wisconsin, United States","date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"SoilNet","description":null,"title":"R&D Engineer","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":4099,"name":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFyYW54n5mwAw/company-logo_400_400/0/1568139083496?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=MEOUKI4Go7FEYLWxMpYuKgny4Lvqb9c516kGpqGbX_0","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/uwmadison/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2021}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Madison, Wisconsin Area","date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2021}},"company":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","description":"Polymer Engineering Center Researcher.

However, we do more than that!\n\nSoil Net LLC was founded in 2002 with the goal of marketing out erosion control and dust abatement technologies. The name Soil Net reflects the use of our original polymer based soil stabilization product. Conventional farming and construction techniques have led to the accumulation of silt in the watershed, which destroys habitat as well as algae blooms choking lakes and rivers. Soil Net LLC was initially created in response to these issues.  Our polymer-based formula forms a stabilizing \u201cnet\u201d to keep the soil, fertilizer, as well as more harmful pollutants from being eroded during construction and rainfall events. Different formulations work in a similar way to keep dust from the air, protecting visibility, mobility, and respiratory health. Water is one of our most valuable resources and our logo stands for our commitment to allow for development and progress while keeping it out of or water.\n\n\nResearch has been central to our growth over time and the development of polymer technology at Soil Net LLC\u2019s state of the art laboratory space in Belleville, WI has led to many technological breakthroughs and patents. In conjunction with our partners across the globe we have licensed novel solutions for consumer lawn and garden, sugar production, cassava processing, mining, sand settling, livestock manure, vegetable oil, waste oil, biodiesel, cheese production, ethanol/cellulosic ethanol production.\n\n\nTo improve the efficacy of our custom solutions and patented technologies we offer state of the art processing equipment and automation. That being said large investments are not at all required, we are successful because Soil Net solutions improve our customer\u2019s bottom line.  We are not an equipment company or a chemical company we are a solutions company. Our customers are our partners, and a Soil Net solution will grow and evolve with your company.\n\n \n","total_emails":3,"location":{"country":"United States","country_code":"US","state":null,"city":"Belleville","timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":"-4.0","postal_code":null,"address":"560 Enterprise Ave"}},"location":{"country":"United States","country_code":"US","state":"Michigan","city":"Clawson","timezone":"America/Detroit","timezone_offset":-4.0,"postal_code":"48017","raw":"Clawson, Michigan, United States"}}}}
