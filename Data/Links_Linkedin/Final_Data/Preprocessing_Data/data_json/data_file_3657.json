I'm open to learn from my colleagues, I also try to teach them as much as I can, quality starts with a proper working environment, a supportive team that is constantly looking for improvement will always look to deliver more value.\nWhat technologies do I use? well, there are a few that I have more experience with, but at the end if you know how to properly do things technologies are just a means, if you still need to know them that's the easiest part of an interview.","premium":false,"skills":"Application Architecture, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Software Quality Assurance, Quality Assurance, Jira, Jenkins, UI Automation, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), JMeter, Performance Testing, JavaScript, Amazon Web Services (AWS), TestNG, Test Automation, Ionic Framework, Angular, docker, Liderazgo de equipos, Programaci\u00f3n","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":18137160,"name":"wefox","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQGAT44XV_KPOA/company-logo_400_400/0/1689061339797?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=rGSyDFoZTI6hwZPNZlC88meD2kMEgE1xPjfzKZaZFmE","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wefox/","employees":{"start":1001,"end":5000}},"date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2023}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Berlin, Germany","date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2023}},"company":"wefox","description":null,"title":"Senior Software Development Engineer in Test","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":3656219,"name":"Pluto TV","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGZrHCTRdNlxg/company-logo_400_400/0/1672701398820?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=P8YOymYb-wrPTX9SCPb25n1D7snX9JUFI1j8EX80Jjw","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/pluto-tv/","employees":{"start":201,"end":500}},"date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2021}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2021}},"company":"Pluto TV","description":null,"title":"Senior Software Test Engineer","employment_type":"Contract"}]},{"company":{"id":9707,"name":"Endava","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFQGjXwWDU2UA/company-logo_400_400/0/1519856330168?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=PP2tXxv7hWwOzP3Uxa6V8-qas7MR9QqyQ6jWc-H1huY","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/endava/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2021}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C.
