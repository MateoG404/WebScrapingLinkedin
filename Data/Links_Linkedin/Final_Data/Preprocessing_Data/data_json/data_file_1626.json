Throughout my carreer, I have also developed  several soft skills such as proactivity, communication, adaptation, work in groups, innovation and leadership. Furthermore, We've participated in water quality studies and used coding (scripts) to prepare and analyse the data produced by models with Machine Learning, geostatistics and multivariate statistical techniques.\n\nI am passionate about evaluating the interlink of the climate-water-food-energy nexus, the impacts on the socio-economic sphere drive me to seek & apply that knowledge. Insights from big data like climatological datasets need speciallized techniques, which I find interesting to learn; those insight have proved to be very valuable for protecting assets.\n\nMethodologies for modelling and designing hydraulic infrastructure (such as water supply networks in aqueducts and buildings, channels, rivers and other hydraulic infrastructure) are also in my portafolio.\n\nMy goal is to keep working with organizations that seek protecting assets & people's livelihoods. That includes NGOs, insurance companies but also with governments; I look for helping growing and grow myself as well.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more, you can contact me through here or email.","premium":false,"skills":"Climate Data Operators (CDO), Water Security, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Energy Management, Food Security, Civil Engineering, Water Resources, Water Supply, Water Treatment, Water Modelling, AutoCAD, Water Management, Road, Highways, Construction, Project Management, Construction Management, Engineering, Project Planning","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":835954,"name":"Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research, University of Bern","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQH0d1P9nqs1Pw/company-logo_400_400/0/1652961892746/oeschger_centre_for_climate_change_research_university_of_bern_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=vS_ClPdLkyRFzvxSOX1JGy52kXHX6NwRBImMgTks-6g","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/oeschger-centre-for-climate-change-research-university-of-bern/","employees":{"start":51,"end":200}},"date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bern, Switzerland","date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern","description":"Sources of hydroclimate variability and its socioeconomic impacts in tropical South America \n- Big data analysis & machine learning -managing own project (objectives, activities, targets, etc)\n- inter-decadal changes in atmospheric and water balance components\n- land-atmosphere-ocean interactions\n- soil moisture & evapotranspiration variability\n- livestock, crop & energy production variability\n- influence of volcanic eruption on climate variability\nhttps://www.geography.unibe.ch/about_us/personen/duque_gardeazbal_nicols/index_eng.html","title":"PHD Researcher","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":null,"name":"National institute for Hydrological, Meteorological and Environmental Studies","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"National institute for Hydrological, Meteorological and Environmental Studies","description":"Hydrometeorological and environmental agency, project with ECOPETROL (National oil company)\n-To characterize hydroclimate variability in the zone and estimate hydroclimatic indices for watershed classification and management (including hydroclimate extremes: drought and floods)\n-To implement a hydrological modelling to acquire water availability estimates in ungauged streams, and to estimate and characterise other hydrological fluxes (modelling with SWAT)\n-To improve the performance of the models by: 1) merging satellite or reanalysis data from rainfall with rain gauge data, 2) by comparing remote sensed fluxes with the models estimates (GLEAM, ESA-CCI soil moisture), 3) recalibrate models parameters to properly represent the fluxes\n-To determine and analyse estimates of ecological discharge\n-To gather hydrometeorological data and analyse the water resources availability at different scales for the middle Magdalena valley.\n-To define the criteria, strategy and actions needed to improve the water resources monitoring in the area\nThe project was an aggrement between the national oil company (Ecopetrol) and the IDEAM","title":"Hydrologist and hydrological modeller","employment_type":"Contract"}]},{"company":{"id":66924431,"name":"National Hydrocarbon Agency","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHPeYpqMAsuSQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1678974230724/agencia_nacional_de_hidrocarburos_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=ursaPQp-6QzXCb9N1kr6y-uDHJX0JBW1m75QsVglZJc","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/agencia-nacional-de-hidrocarburos/","employees":{"start":501,"end":1000}},"date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2020}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C.","date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2020}},"company":"Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos","description":"Analyse and plan which hydrological models are suitable to implement to estimate the streamflow in a data scarse basin;
