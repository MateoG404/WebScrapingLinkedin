Today, it is the largest institute of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. \n\nResearch at Fraunhofer IIS revolves around two guiding topics:\nIn the area of \u201cAudio and Media Technologies\u201d, the institute has been shaping the digitalization of media for more than 30 years now. Fraunhofer IIS was instrumental in the development of mp3 and AAC and played a significant role in the digitalization of the cinema. Current developments are opening up whole new sound worlds and are being used in virtual reality, automotive sound systems, mobile telephony, streaming and broadcasting.\n\nIn the context of \u201ccognitive sensor technologies\u201d, the institute researches technologies for sensor technology, data transmission technology, data analysis methods and the exploitation of data as part of data-driven services and their accompanying business models. This adds a cognitive component to the function of the conventional \u201csmart\u201d sensor. The results of this research have been applied in the areas of connected mobility, communication and application solutions for the Internet of Things, digitalization of human sensing, product and material monitoring, and business analytics in supply chains.\n\nMore than 1170 employees conduct contract research for industry, the service sector and public authorities. Founded in 1985 in Erlangen, Fraunhofer IIS now has locations in 11 cities: Erlangen (headquarters), N\u00fcrnberg, F\u00fcrth and Dresden, as well as Bamberg, Deggendorf, Ilmenau, M\u00fcnchen, Passau, Waischenfeld and W\u00fcrzburg. 72 percent of the budget of 189,7 million euros a year is financed by contract research projects. Institutional funding from the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft covers 28 percent of the budget.\n\nMore information: http://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html\nImprint: http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/imprint.html","total_emails":262,"location":{"country":"Germany","country_code":"DE","state":null,"city":"Erlangen","timezone":"Europe/Berlin","timezone_offset":"2.0","postal_code":null,"address":"Am Wolfsmantel 33"}},"location":{"country":"Germany","country_code":"DE","state":"Bavaria","city":"Erlangen","timezone":"Europe/Berlin","timezone_offset":2.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany"}}}}
