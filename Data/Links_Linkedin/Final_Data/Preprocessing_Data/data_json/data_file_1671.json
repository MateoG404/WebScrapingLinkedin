This project was developed in partnership with Givaudan \u00ae over a period of 6 months. The subject was to reduce the sugar content of a dairy product. The challenge was to preserve the softness and texture of the product. For this purpose, sweeteners and technologies developed by Givaudan were used. I had the support of flavour specialists, dairy production and a sensory analysis team. During this work, I had the responsibility to find the right blend of sweeteners and technology to have the same sweetness as sugar. So I had to prepare the dairy product and ensure the same texture as the product with sugar.","title":"Internship","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":null,"name":"SBC - Sustancias B\u00e1sicas Colombianas","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2017},"end":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2017}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2017},"end":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2017}},"company":"SBC - Sustancias B\u00e1sicas Colombianas","description":"In charge of the quality laboratory.
