My responsibilities included establishing the technical requirements for the electronic tongue, developing electrolytic solutions, interpreting and evaluating P&ID diagrams, evaluating and redesigning the conceptual engineering of an electronic nose, and designing experiments to understand the effects of physicochemical parameters on response variables and optimize operational parameters.\n\nAs part of the team, we successfully developed an electronic tongue that integrates various electrochemical techniques and enables the detection of 11 metals in aqueous matrices, ranging from 10 parts per billion (ppb) and higher. Additionally, I designed and synthesized a cost-effective PVC membrane potentiometric electrode for detecting light metals, resulting in a 60% reduction in production costs. I also developed an electrolyte solution that enables electrochemical quantification of all 11 metals simultaneously at parts-per-billion scale. Moreover, I utilized Python programming to analyze electrochemical data, employing data science techniques for data cleaning, validation, and visualization.\n\nIt was a rewarding experience to contribute to the research and development of advanced technologies for environmental monitoring and metal detection.","title":"Chemical  and Environmental Development
