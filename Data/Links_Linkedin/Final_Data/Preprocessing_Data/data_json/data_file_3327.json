This work began in Panama in 1910, when the Smithsonian led one of the world\u2019s first major environmental impact studies, which surveyed and catalogued the flora and fauna of the lowland tropical forests that would be flooded with the creation of the Panama Canal. A century later, the Smithsonian in Panama is a standard-setting global platform for groundbreaking research on tropical forests and marine ecosystems and their astounding biodiversity.\n\nToday, STRI employs 40 staff scientists and hosts some 1,400 scientific visitors every year, from undergrads and interns to postdoctoral investigators and tenured research associates. Together, they collaborate on 350 running research projects and publish more than 400 peer reviewed articles in scientific journals every year. The research is not only shared widely around the global scientific community, but also reaches policymakers in Panama and beyond, receives media coverage around the globe, and is the foundation of an outreach and training program that reaches hundreds of teachers and tens of thousands of schoolchildren every year.","total_emails":0,"location":{"country":"Panama","country_code":"PA","state":null,"city":"Panama","timezone":"America/Panama","timezone_offset":"-5.0","postal_code":null,"address":null}},"location":{"country":"Colombia","country_code":"CO","state":null,"city":null,"timezone":"America/Bogota","timezone_offset":-5.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Colombia"}}}}
