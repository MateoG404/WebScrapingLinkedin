Its integration in a silicon wafer and the posterior inclusion in the package need new solutions and better analysis at electrical and physical level to keep signal integrity and to meet the specifications with the lower costs. To meet such specifications it is important to choose the package in a proper way based in the use of radiofrequencies techniques: transmission and reflection losses, crosstalk, differential impedance, link budget and power integrity.\nThe internship will consist in a SERDES 28Gbit/s integration in a Ball Grid Array package (BGA). The stages of the project will be the next:\n1). Study of a typical configuration for a differential pair in a package: modeling and results analysis.\n2). Identification of the elements which have a direct influence in the package performance: transmission line, transition elements (vias, bumps, balls), materials, coupling and isolation.\n3). Parametrical study of the structures that could guarantee meeting the specifications with the lower costs to maximize the performances in a determined technology: package layers (number, materials, width\u2026) vias (number, size, placement.)\n4). Implementation of a method which will help to take decisions in the future works in these devices related with the products inventory.\nThe internship will have as target to optimize the performances of the serial links working at 28Gbit/s in the package that integrates them.","title":"Internship","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":1398701,"name":"Grenoble INP IMEP-LAHC","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGavyT8GdBXWQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1551004086886?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=R2d_kGSC4Gejr5PkW9ivsomTKkpUSEPSbxxl8y2Onvc","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/grenoble-inp-imep-lahc/","employees":{"start":51,"end":200}},"date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2015}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"R\u00e9gion de Grenoble, France","date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2015}},"company":"Grenoble INP GIPSA-lab","description":"Set up of a testbench of micropumps made of silicon to be used in biomedical devices.
