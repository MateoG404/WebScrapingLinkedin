In line with its motto \"Photonics for Life\"\u200b, the scientists at IPHT are investigating photonic and biophotonic processes and systems to address issues in the fields of medicine and the life and environmental sciences.\n\nFROM IDEAS TO INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe insights gained from research are converted into application-oriented procedures, instrumental concepts, and laboratory samples at IPHT. With this orientation, the institute contributes to the solution of pressing issues in our society, such as in health, energy, and the environment.\n\nIPHT is involved in research and development at the interface of three focal points in research: fiber optics, photonic detection, and biophotonics. Biophotonics serves as the link to all research activities at the institute. Together with the two research areas fiber optics and photonic detection, new photonic processes are being developed and transferred into innovative application-oriented systems.\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL BASIS\n\nIPHT possesses the know-how and an outstanding technological basis in the areas of system technology, fiber technology, photonic detection, and micro/nanotechnology. Together with outstanding technical equipment and infrastructure, IPHT possesses a state-of-the-art, closed technology chain. In addition to the constant expansion of IPHT\u2019s technological potential, the research aims at reaching new levels in photonic and biophotonic solutions with regard to resolution, sensitivity, specificity, speed, and automation.","total_emails":421,"location":{"country":"Germany","country_code":"DE","state":null,"city":"Jena","timezone":"Europe/Berlin","timezone_offset":"2.0","postal_code":null,"address":"Albert-Einstein-Str. 9"}},"location":{"country":"Germany","country_code":"DE","state":"Thuringia","city":"Jena","timezone":"Europe/Berlin","timezone_offset":2.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Jena, Thuringia, Germany"}}}}
