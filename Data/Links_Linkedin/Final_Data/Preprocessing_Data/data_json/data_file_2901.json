(\u201cRBI\u201d), which owns three of the world\u2019s iconic quick service restaurant brands \u2013 Burger King\u00ae, Tim Hortons\u00ae, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen\u00ae. But we still have room to grow \u2013 and that\u2019s where you come in. We need strong operations, bold marketing, and the best people around to make these brands great. And if we like what we see, there\u2019s no limit to how far you could go here.\n \nFor more information and exciting career opportunities, please RBI\u2019s website at www.rbicareers.com.\n \nFor more information about Burger King Corporation, please visit the company\u2019s website at www.bk.com or follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\n \nBurger King is a registered trademark of Burger King Corporation.
