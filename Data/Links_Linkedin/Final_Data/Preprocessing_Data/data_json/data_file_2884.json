I have a Master's degree in Information and Automation Engineering from the University of Bremen, Germany. I have more than six years of experience in innovation projects related to data analysis and artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a scientific researcher at the Institute of Production and Logistics of Bremen, I used neural networks to detect defects in sealants for aeronautical use, to process 3D data for volume detection in food, and to predict the trajectory of people for safety in construction sites. I also developed a system based on artificial intelligence to detect defects in textiles, and automated repetitive processes using Python. I am passionate about creating and implementing cutting-edge technologies that improve the quality and efficiency of products and processes. I am fluent in Spanish, English, and German, and I have a strong background in electronics engineering.","premium":false,"skills":"Project Coordination, Machine Learning, Sales Processes, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, Predictive Modeling, Data Science, Data Analytics, Budget Forecasting, Sales Operations, SQL, Statistical Data Analysis, ASPX, Microsoft Report Builder, Project Management, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Project Engineering, Data Analysis","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":null,"name":"Buho Network SAS","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Cajic\u00e1,Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Buho Network SAS","description":"- Creation of software for business data analysis and customer management for the company.\n- Creation of an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting defects in textiles.\n- Automation of repetitive processes using Python.","title":"Chief Technology Officer","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":9457714,"name":"BIBA -
