INCLAM bid in taking a leap to Alternative Stock Markets (MaB), where it started its listing in July 2015. This significant step was motivated by the Company\u00b4s expansion process.\n\nINCLAM was established in 1986 focused on engineering in the water sector. In just a few years the company converted into the leading hydrology and hydraulics consultant in Spain, working more or less entirely for public institutions in these spheres. At that point the company decided to expand its operation to Latin America, furthermore, offering turnkey projects for water treatment and hydraulic works.\n\nIn 2005 the Company started to grow in the European markets. At the same time, and as a response to the social demand towards the new challenges posed by climate change, Inclam took a step further in its environmental commitment and extended its services through INCLAM CO2, advising its clients on projects related to adaptation, mitigation, and trading of emission rights.\n\nCurrently, and thanks to its international expansion, the INCLAM group has permanent delegations in Latin America, Central America, Colombia and the Caribbean, and offices in Spain, Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and representation agreements in these and other regions, which strengthens its presence in strategic markets.\n\nINCLAM\u00b4s activities are divided into four different main lines: (1) Consulting, (2) Engineering, Procurement and Construction, i.e. EPC, turnkey projects, (3) Project and Construction Management (4) Climate Change. The technological factor has always been a part of Company\u00b4s activities, and it has worked as a transverse axis to all the divisions. Research and innovation are our motivation to improve our technique. We pioneer hydrological and hydraulic software development.","total_emails":52,"location":{"country":"Spain","country_code":"ES","state":null,"city":"Madrid","timezone":"Europe/Madrid","timezone_offset":"2.0","postal_code":null,"address":"Limonero 22"}},"location":{"country":"Colombia","country_code":"CO","state":null,"city":"Bogota","timezone":"America/Bogota","timezone_offset":-5.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia"}}}}
