Ph.D. student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, working on warm precipitation and cloud microphysics. My current research focuses on improving cloud microphysical models to reduce uncertainty in surface rainfall estimation from spaceborne radars by analyzing data from in-situ cloud probes on board the NASA P-3 and SPEC Learjet aircraft deployed during the NASA CAMP2Ex field campaign. I am also highly interested in machine learning models for environmental sciences, cloud simulation using WRF and MPAS models, big data analysis and visualization, analysis-ready cloud-optimized data formats to store scientific datasets, high-performance computing, and collaborative open-source code using the Python ecosystem.","premium":false,"skills":"Big data, Python, Weather Radars, Rain Microphysics, Disdrometers, Quantitative Estimation Precipitation - QPE","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":2650,"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGFFDl_Z9pIAA/company-logo_400_400/0/1595014871850?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=QfFzpFjxsTx90akz7LkR_-Si7njfB5dT8qs3ReEtiqQ","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Estados Unidos","date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","description":null,"title":"Graduate Student","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":null,"name":"Instituto de Hidrolog\u00eda, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM) - Colombia","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020}},"company":"Instituto de Hidrolog\u00eda, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM) - Colombia","description":null,"title":"Radar Meteorologist","employment_type":null}]}],"education":[{"date":{"start":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2025}},"school":{"name":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGFFDl_Z9pIAA/company-logo_400_400/0/1595014871850?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=QfFzpFjxsTx90akz7LkR_-Si7njfB5dT8qs3ReEtiqQ","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign/"},"degree_name":"Doctor of Philosophy - PhD","field_of_study":"Ciencias atmosf\u00e9ricas y meteorolog\u00eda","grade":null},{"date":{"start":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2014},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2017}},"school":{"name":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQH2fxFDcpvbGw/company-logo_400_400/0/1689003876228?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=oVQVqLNBVhz0_4o5t3feqTSjZMfyfQMMF5QywUGGj8I","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/universidadnacionaldecolombia/"},"degree_name":"Maestr\u00eda","field_of_study":"MSc.
