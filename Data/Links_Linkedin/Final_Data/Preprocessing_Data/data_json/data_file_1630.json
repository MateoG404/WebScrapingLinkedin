I hold an MSc. and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Campinas.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have conducted extensive research in various areas, including photovoltaic devices, atmospheric discharges, transmission lines, and optimization using both classical and heuristic methods. To carry out these research projects, I have utilized programming languages such as Python, Matlab, and C#. One of my recent research endeavors involved optimizing multi-circuit transmission lines using evolutionary computation and parallel computing techniques. As part of this work, I automated numerous tests using Python and Matlab, enabling seamless interaction with external software like PSCAD and ATP. Additionally, I have shared my knowledge by teaching Python, Fortran, and C to fellow researchers and professionals, with a specific focus on automating PSCAD simulations.\n\nBeyond my research activities, I contribute as a volunteer reviewer for ELSEVIER Electric Power Systems Research. Moreover, I played an important role in the organization of the International Conference on Power Systems Transients (IPST) 2019, serving as the technical chair assistant.\n\nI have gained practical engineering experience in Colombia, having worked on diverse projects ranging from service stations and project management to transmission lines.\n\nMy current areas of interest revolve around HVDC, transmission lines, transient analysis, optimization, machine learning, and bio-inspired algorithms. To enhance my knowledge in these domains, I have pursued relevant coursework in power systems, neural networks, and natural computing at the University of Campinas. \n\nLattes:            http://lattes.cnpq.br/6143987038747533 \nMyCitations:  https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=RYrp4NgAAAAJ \nResearchID:   http://www.researcherid.com/rid/S-6348-2016 \nORCID:          http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0345-998X","premium":false,"skills":"Electrical Engineering, Electronica, AutoCAD, Ingenier\u00eda, Linux, Ingenier\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica, C++, Energ\u00eda, English, Strategic Planning, Research, Project Management, Team Leadership, Energy, Neural networks, Optimization, Genetic algorithms, Python, artificial intelligence, machine learning","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":2220993,"name":"Manitoba Hydro International","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFEFYcYcYwxZg/company-logo_400_400/0/1533659461036?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=_HA3g8yP1TcTW7h3XDh_7XDhJd4mqG1hh-xwvrzF1JQ","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/manitoba-hydro-international/","employees":{"start":51,"end":200}},"date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Manitoba Hydro International","description":null,"title":"MITACS Elevate Postdoctoral Fellow ","employment_type":"Internship"}]},{"company":{"id":11692,"name":"University of Manitoba","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQHv5yCvtn9GFg/company-logo_400_400/0/1664753624837?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=erl_1ii24pXAVtbg-Tmn5-YF04y64bJceXPLNBrQPSw","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/umanitoba/","employees":{"start":5001,"end":10000}},"date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":null,"date":{"start":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"University of Manitoba","description":"Currently, I am working on HVDC problems, using high-performance computing with PSCAD automation through Python.","title":"Postdoctoral Fellow","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":986104,"name":"Universidade Estadual de Campinas","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGkepCvZp_oww/company-logo_400_400/0/1519892290621?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=XLHhpvNsNTJdm0QGbe1aFImTq2JBJnVuGfS-W91bhBY","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/universidade-estadual-de-campinas/","employees":{"start":5001,"end":10000}},"date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil","date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"Universidade Estadual de Campinas","description":"During this time I did the following activities:\n\n1) I studied how to reduce the secondary arc current (SAC) in optimized transmission lines.
