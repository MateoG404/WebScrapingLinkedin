People also talk about their achievements or previous job experiences.\nMechanical Engineer from the National University of Colombia. I finished my master's degree in semi-organic Solar Cells at the University of Tokyo, Japan with the Monbokagakusho Scholarship. Currently working as a Hydropower Turbine Generator designer at Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions in Yokohama, Japan. For five years I have been in charge of the detailed mechanical design and final specifications for the production of Hydropower generators. My role starts with the mechanical design and improvement of current technologies and reaches the final procedures of assembly of the machine, also dealing with the customer and any possible non-conformity in the process. Self-challenger. Always finding new ways to do things simplest and better. I enjoy finding something to learn about different people's cultures and languages. Flexible to changes and at this moment I am looking for new tasks that impel me to go further as a professional.","premium":false,"skills":"AutoCAD, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Communication, Fluid Mechanics, SOLIDWORKS, machining learning, Engineering, Energy Systems, Organic Solar Cells, Pyrolysis, Hydropower, Foreign Languages, English, japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Detailed Design, Cross-functional Team Leadership, C (Programming Language), Python (Programming Language), Siemens NX","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":157301,"name":"Toshiba","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQEYoBbsswD1Iw/company-logo_400_400/0/1578581958982/toshiba_americas_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=w8sekABirK7CkBx7Wd32-vWod-S5GA8TKmW23_P7ULA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/toshiba-americas/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"\u65e5\u672c \u795e\u5948\u5ddd\u770c \u6a2a\u6d5c","date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Toshiba","description":"Currently working in the design department for hydropower generators of Toshiba Energy Systems. \nI am in charge of the detailed mechanical design and final specifications for the production of Hydropgenerators.
