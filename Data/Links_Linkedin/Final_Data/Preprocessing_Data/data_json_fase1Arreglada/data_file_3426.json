The multi-billion dollar project will transform the GO regional rail network with electrification, more frequent service, shorter journey times and a more modernized system and services for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. \n \nONxpress is comprised of an international partnership that brings very well established expertise to each area of the project: Aecon Construction Group, ALSTOM Transport Canada, DB International Operations, Part of DB E.C.O. Group, and FCC Canada Ltd. have come together to deliver on Metrolinx's vision that will transform GO transit rail service.\n\nThe Project will bring frequent, all day, two-way rail service to the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.  The investment will generate thousands of new jobs and create economic opportunities across the region. The project will include adding over 200 kilometres of new track and electrifying over 600 kilometres of track. A new electric train fleet will also be introduced. The GO Expansion project also includes a re-design of Union Station platforms, upgraded track and signal technology, plus new quieter, cleaner electric locomotives that will improve the passenger experience. \n\nMore trains means greater options, fewer cars on the road, and better air for everyone. \n\nPlease look at us and consider our job openings and join the team as we create a new transit system.","total_emails":0,"location":{"country":"Canada","country_code":"CA","state":null,"city":"Toronto","timezone":"America/St_Johns","timezone_offset":"-2.5","postal_code":null,"address":null}},"location":{"country":"Canada","country_code":"CA","state":"Ontario","city":"North York","timezone":"America/Toronto","timezone_offset":-4.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"North York, Ontario, Canada"}}}}
