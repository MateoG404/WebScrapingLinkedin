The ultimate benefit of cloud computing, and AWS, is the ability to leverage a new business model and turn capital infrastructure expenses into variable costs. Businesses no longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost.\r\n\r\nToday, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Singapore, and Japan, customers across all industries are taking advantage of our low cost, elastic, open and flexible, secure platform.","total_emails":1000,"location":{"country":"United States","country_code":"US","state":null,"city":"Seattle","timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":"-4.0","postal_code":null,"address":"410 Terry Ave N"}},"location":{"country":"Colombia","country_code":"CO","state":null,"city":"Bogota","timezone":"America/Bogota","timezone_offset":-5.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia"}}}}
