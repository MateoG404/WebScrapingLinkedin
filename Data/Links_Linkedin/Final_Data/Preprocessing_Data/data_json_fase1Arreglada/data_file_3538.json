Initially starting as a partnership in Astoria Queens, that catered to the carriage trade in 1910 New York City, the business was established in Whitestone, home to many other greenhouse operations.  \r\n\r\nThe original firm remained in Whitestone until Mr. Muller's death in the 1960s. Otto Muller's son-in-law, Kurt Weiss, and grandson Russell Weiss, developed the East Meadow facility that had been purchased in 1929. In 1960, the operation was incorporated as Kurt Weiss Florist, the forerunner of the present company.\r\n\r\nAs the customer base shifted, in the 1970s, from New York City retail flower shops to larger volume grocery chains and wholesale distributors, sales exceeded production. Russell Weiss decided to purchase the well known firms of Dupuy Greenhouses and Daurenheim Inc.. The latter, which was the number one pot plant grower of the time, could trace its origins back to the 1850s in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nFurther growth ensued... \r\n\r\nPresently the organization consists of 18 separate operations, 6 on long island, 2 in Florida, 2 in South Carolina, 1 in Connecticut, 3 in Pennsylvania, 1 in New Jersey, 2 in upstate New York and 1 in Canada with a combined total of over 14 million square feet. \r\n\r\nTaking advantage of there geographic diversity, the individual facilities give the company a unique depth of product. Coupled with their commitment to providing quality product and excellent service, their status as an industry leader has cemented a platform for the next generation to grow the family's business.","total_emails":22,"location":{"country":"United States","country_code":"US","state":null,"city":"Center Moriches","timezone":"America/New_York","timezone_offset":"-4.0","postal_code":null,"address":"95 Main St"}},"location":{"country":"Colombia","country_code":"CO","state":null,"city":"Bogota","timezone":"America/Bogota","timezone_offset":-5.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia"}}}}
