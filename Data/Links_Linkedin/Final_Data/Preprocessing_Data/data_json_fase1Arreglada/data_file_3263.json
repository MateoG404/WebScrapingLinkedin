Enthusiastic about sustainable transport and smart mobility, behaviour change, transport demand management, and logistics. I help governments, decision-makers, policymakers, developers, and investors to shape the future of transport and cities; that is, to foster liveable cities and help build a more sustainable future. \n\nMy experience involves a broad range of mobility-related projects in several countries which have provided me with a deep understanding of the mobility systems of regions and cities. Learning about these complexities, these projects have equipped me with first-rate technical, leadership and interpersonal abilities.\n\nAs project manager and technical expert, I am  responsible for managing projects and proposals related to transport in a broad perspective and scope  , involving multidisciplinary and international team coordination as well as direct client relationships. The projects varied from design micro-mobility schemes for large cities to analysing the market of electric versus diesel buses in several countries and advising city governments in matters of fleet replacement based on cost models and sustainable objectives.\n\nMy academic background includes a BSc in Civil Engineering, a diploma in Traffic, Road Design and Road Safety, and an MSc in Transportation Engineering, with a master thesis titled \"Development of a Logistics Performance Index  for the analysis of the Colombian Altillanura\". Technical skills include proficiency in Vissim, Stata, Lighthouse Studio (Sawtooth software), AutoCAD, and Microsoft Office Suite, among others.","premium":false,"skills":"Ingenier\u00eda civil, Ingenier\u00eda del tr\u00e1fico, Microsimulaci\u00f3n, Gesti\u00f3n de proyectos, Microsoft Office, Liderazgo, Administraci\u00f3n y direcci\u00f3n de empresas, Servicio de atenci\u00f3n al cliente, AutoCAD, Trabajo en equipo, Planeamiento de proyectos, Ingenier\u00eda, Microsoft Excel, Planificaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica, Ingl\u00e9s, Transporte, Liderazgo de equipos, Investigaci\u00f3n y desarrollo, Sostenibilidad, Microsoft PowerPoint","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":12514,"name":"IDOM Consulting, Engineering, Architecture","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQEqvVU_lYiosw/company-logo_400_400/0/1677838633944/idom_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=5x7ec7rjyz0eJ6WoELQ8NX2YYrkapZV2JnmHdl9atuA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/idom/","employees":{"start":5001,"end":10000}},"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":null,"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"IDOM Consulting, Engineering, Architecture","description":null,"title":"Senior mobility consultant","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":20840,"name":"Steer","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHYt5H2smHZbw/company-logo_400_400/0/1656684157753/steer_group_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=b2ffRKJJHKXzrg1GqOyMipI-GBCmqpXPsiLTZJlLZv8","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/steer-group/","employees":{"start":201,"end":500}},"date":{"start":{"month":10,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023}},"profile_positions":[{"location":null,"date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023}},"company":"Steer","description":null,"title":"Principal consultant","employment_type":null},{"location":null,"date":{"start":{"month":10,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":10,"day":null,"year":2021}},"company":"Steer","description":null,"title":"Senior consultant","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":20840,"name":"Steer Davies Gleave","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHYt5H2smHZbw/company-logo_400_400/0/1656684157753/steer_group_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=b2ffRKJJHKXzrg1GqOyMipI-GBCmqpXPsiLTZJlLZv8","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/steer-group/","employees":{"start":201,"end":500}},"date":{"start":{"month":2,"day":null,"year":2014},"end":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2017}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C., Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2017},"end":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2017}},"company":"Steer","description":null,"title":"Senior Consultant","employment_type":null},{"location":"Bogot\u00e1","date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2015},"end":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2017}},"company":"Steer","description":null,"title":"Consultant","employment_type":null},{"location":null,"date":{"start":{"month":2,"day":null,"year":2014},"end":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2015}},"company":"Steer","description":null,"title":"Assistant consultant","employment_type":null}]}],"education":[{"date":{"start":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2020}},"school":{"name":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQH2fxFDcpvbGw/company-logo_400_400/0/1689003876228/universidadnacionaldecolombia_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=TfG2V6lateX-vzeuhZie-tCjeKI3rsuPi1CUwJ63FDI","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/universidadnacionaldecolombia/"},"degree_name":"Mag\u00edster en Ingenier\u00eda -
