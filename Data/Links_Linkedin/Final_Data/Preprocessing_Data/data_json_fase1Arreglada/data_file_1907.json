This made me quite a curious person and of course, I became an engineer.\n\nI really enjoyed my time in university building circuits and coding programs, but I found something that particularly kept my attention when I came to France for an exchange program. I found out how much I like the systems that we use for processing signals and because of this I focused my profesional future in audio and image processing.\n\nI always have to be learning something, that's why I got close to initiatives like edx.org and try to get as many certificates as possible. \n\nEven if I'm a science guy, I enjoy art (I think I have visited all the Parisian museums) and sports.","premium":false,"skills":"OpenCV, C++, Git, Linux, Python (langage de programmation), Bash, Python, Linux Kernel, Vision par ordinateur, Traitement du signal, Simulations, Int\u00e9gration, \u00c9lectronique, D\u00e9veloppement pour Android, D\u00e9bogage, Script Shell, Test unitaire, Matlab, Java, MATLAB","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":34905,"name":"LTU","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHEPF7LH8at0w/company-logo_400_400/0/1626341140072?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=gRwBTOG8LzATypu2cZoi9dwzrYtIJG94n-nc8fXXfic","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ltu-tech/","employees":{"start":11,"end":50}},"date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Paris, \u00cele-de-France, France","date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"LTU","description":"Development, enhancement and maintenance of Computer Vision algorithms.","title":"Research And Development Engineer","employment_type":"Permanent"}]},{"company":{"id":2669,"name":"Valeo","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQF8x8kpXJLBkg/company-logo_400_400/0/1571910608340?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=ESSHTckbMrvppOkZtDhhrTpxiKY4kqr_z-C67zhtcsg","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/valeo/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Ville de Paris, \u00cele-de-France, France","date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"Valeo","description":"development of imaging systems software for an automotive environment.","title":"Vision Team - Embedded Systems Developper chez Valeo","employment_type":"Permanent"},{"location":"Cr\u00e9teil, \u00cele-de-France, France","date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2018},"end":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2020}},"company":"Valeo","description":"Part of the Driver Monitoring System in the R&D division.\n\n\u2022 Imageacquisitionandenhancementsystemdevelopmentforspecific\nsensors.
