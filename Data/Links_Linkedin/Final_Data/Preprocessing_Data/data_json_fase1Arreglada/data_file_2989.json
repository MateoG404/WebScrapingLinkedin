For this international experience I was also a selected candidate for the Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP) scholarship offered by the Government of Canada.\n\nTo top it all off, I am currently developing a startup in the Agri-Food Tech sector with all of the knowledge and experience I have. This personal endeavour was born from a course project at university and has been strengthened over time with the help of numerous connections and highly knowledgeable individuals in the Colombian entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n\nIf you would like to get to know me better or feel that connecting can add value to a personal or professional project in development lets get in touch with a message or call me at +57 312 479 0960.","premium":false,"skills":"Problem Solving, Analytical Skills, Leadership, Public Speaking, Product Innovation, Front End Engineering Design (FEED), Piping and Instrumentation Drawing (P&ID), Process Simulation, Team Building, Community Outreach, Networking, Prototyping, Food Design, Process Engineering, Sustainable Design, Sustainability, Research, Project Management, Marketing, International Relations","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":9826,"name":"Wood","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQFq3zsItxSxQQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1688139373877/woodplc_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=eNi_w08zP6ccqbYWDD56y9yk_cFWNVuJ-PuOzPf0j-E","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/woodplc/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":5,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 D.C.
