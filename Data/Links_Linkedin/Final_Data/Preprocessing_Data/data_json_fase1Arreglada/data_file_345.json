Computational Fluid Dynamics | Mechanical Engineer","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-sebastian-diaz-camacho","summary":"I am a person who is easy to work with in various environments, committed, a fast learner and a great co-worker. I always try to learn as much as possible about the problems I deal with, both on a personal and professional level, providing realistic solutions. During my professional experience, I've worked on machine design using CAD tools in factories and start-ups, additionally, I've been able to be part of large projects such as the expansion of the Salitre Water Waste Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Bogota, Colombia.\n\nThe fundamental role of Computational simulations in engineering drove me to pursue MSc in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at Cranfield University where I made use of various tools such as OpenFoam, ANSYS Fluent, Pointwise, Tecplot, etc. during a number of projects. I'm looking for challenges where I can put my knowledge to use, improve it and while doing so have a great multidisciplinary team.","premium":false,"skills":"Pointwise, Trabajo en equipo, Pensamiento l\u00f3gico y r\u00e1pido, Autodesk Inventor (CAD), Adaptabilidad, Dise\u00f1o asistido por ordenador (CAD), Autodesk Inventor, Elementos finitos","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":162534,"name":"Arup","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQGJio-1N-Cssg/company-logo_400_400/0/1686582688363?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=S8pjprDY5BNb4HDz6LUbvLJf_fhIjS79OBu5xv24i6I","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/arup/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":2,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1, Distrito Capital, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":2,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Arup","description":null,"title":"Renewable Energy Specialist","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":null,"name":"INNREF SAS","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2021}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 DC, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":6,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2021}},"company":"INNREF SAS","description":"\u2022 Design of mechanical components aimed to be part of a linear motion mechanism which plays an important role in a measurement device\n\u2022 Assembly of prototype and Minimum Viable Product\n\u2022 3D Printing of mechanical components and cases, mainly using PLA, to protect electronic devices","title":"Mechanical Engineer","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":35690117,"name":"Ugni.io","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHRez3PLaGmVg/company-logo_400_400/0/1562950000041?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=rqsGlKtocmYrYHAj4na3bTLr8AxRyG2-FWYIiqyETrA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ugni/","employees":{"start":11,"end":50}},"date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2020}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1 DC, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2020},"end":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2020}},"company":"Ugni.io","description":"Design, elaboration of manufacturing drawings and installation of steel brackets aimed to hold weight sensors meant to measure the capacity of public transport buses in Bogota, Colombia.","title":"Mechanical Engineer","employment_type":"Part-time"}]},{"company":{"id":null,"name":"Consorcio Expansion Ptar Salitre","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2019},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2019}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogota DC, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2019},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2019}},"company":"Consorcio Expansion Ptar Salitre","description":"Scheduling the contractors' activities that are to be carried out during the week, monitoring their progress and reporting the results achieved.
