I am interested in the research sector, especially in the region of Latin America. \n\nBeing a teacher assistant at my home university for two consecutive semesters, reflects all my compromises and motivations in the academic background. \n\nAlso as a volunteer in the global NGO AIESEC, I have had the chance to interact with people from all over the world, and that has allowed me to develop my leadership, teamwork, fast-learning, and adaptation skills, as well as opened my mind. As my theoretical and practical experiences have created a profound desire to explore the world and its different cultures, I envision a future career in cultural studies and diplomacy.","premium":false,"skills":"Liderazgo, Relaciones internacionales, Cooperaci\u00f3n internacional, Voluntariado, Social Listening, Investigation, Writing, Academic Writing, Film, Leadership, Team Building, Team Leadership, English, Spanish, Historical Research, General Investigations","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":2034,"name":"AIESEC","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFNIFKL5h461A/company-logo_400_400-alternative/0/1628881223590/aiesec_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=Gw2wUjWDVOF1Avr9N2yArM61U1YO2FxeQZq5RdnJmQk","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/aiesec/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":10,"day":null,"year":2019},"end":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1, Distrito Capital, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":10,"day":null,"year":2019},"end":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"AIESEC","description":"I volunteered in the world largest NGO for youth.
