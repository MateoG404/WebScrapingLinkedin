My incessant desire for knowledge led me to conquer a master's degree in geotechnics based on pavements materials, thus consolidating my knowledge and appreciation for this field of engineering. Currently, I am immersed in the exciting journey of a PhD in Civil Engineering, where I seek to push the limits of innovation even further with a research on the fatigue behaviour of bituminous materials.","premium":false,"skills":"Research, Civil Engineering, Pavements, Geotechnics, Project Planning","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":15091885,"name":"ENTPE","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C510BAQFhqliYmR1xzQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1519895600272?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=Bm0xoxQK64-twwqPuCJ6bMU1XfIGQzrhHtxhjKZD0GI","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/entpe/","employees":{"start":201,"end":500}},"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Vaulx-en-Velin, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, France","date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Ecole nationale des Travaux publics de l'Etat","description":"CIRCOPAV Project\nWorking on: Impact of climate change on fatigue service life of road pavements","title":"Doctoral Researcher","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":15091885,"name":"Ecole nationale des Travaux publics de l'Etat","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C510BAQFhqliYmR1xzQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1519895600272?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=Bm0xoxQK64-twwqPuCJ6bMU1XfIGQzrhHtxhjKZD0GI","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/entpe/","employees":{"start":201,"end":500}},"date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":3,"day":null,"year":2023}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"France","date":{"start":{"month":9,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":3,"day":null,"year":2023}},"company":"Ecole nationale des Travaux publics de l'Etat","description":"Rheological properties of polymer modified bitumen (PMB)","title":"Research Intern","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":464241,"name":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQH2fxFDcpvbGw/company-logo_400_400/0/1689003876228?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=oVQVqLNBVhz0_4o5t3feqTSjZMfyfQMMF5QywUGGj8I","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/universidadnacionaldecolombia/","employees":{"start":5001,"end":10000}},"date":{"start":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":12,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia","description":"Inter-administrative Contract, No ICCU \u2013 501 of 2021 Signed between the Institute of Infrastructure and Concessions of Cundinamarca \u2013 ICCU and Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
