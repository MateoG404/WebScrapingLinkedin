I am a Unity  Developer with some experience in mobile games and graduated from the first Generation Colombia bootcamp, where I participated in some game jams and developed  a final project with an amazing team. I have also worked with some frontend technologies like React and with some backend like flask. I am currently learning C++.\n\nI am passionate about creating immersive experiences and I want to leave a print with my work. I strongly believe that anyone can achieve anything if time, effort, perseverance, and passion are put onto it. I want to be part of great games and technology releases and push my creativity to its limits.\n\nIn these years learning development I have had the opportunity to create some games: two of them as personal projects and the third one as a project with a development school. I have also been involved in the frontend of some web pages. I am constantly learning anything I am curious about, and I am trying to be better every day.\n\nYou can see some of my work here: maucamsan.itch.io\nGithub: https://github.com/maucamsan","premium":false,"skills":"Hojas de estilos en cascada (CSS), Programaci\u00f3n orientada a objetos (POO), Desarrollo de videojuegos, C#, Ingl\u00e9s, Programaci\u00f3n, Ingenier\u00eda mec\u00e1nica, Estrategia, Resoluci\u00f3n de problemas","work_experience":[],"education":[{"date":{"start":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2013},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":2019}},"school":{"name":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQH2fxFDcpvbGw/company-logo_400_400/0/1689003876228/universidadnacionaldecolombia_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=TfG2V6lateX-vzeuhZie-tCjeKI3rsuPi1CUwJ63FDI","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/universidadnacionaldecolombia/"},"degree_name":null,"field_of_study":null,"grade":null},{"date":{"start":{"month":11,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"school":{"name":"Tokio New Technology School","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGiZHntnQbgWQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1519890461237?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=UqwE5crl7Vl--A1JJtY1mRP6DXKW7VvFBO9uoKQta-8","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/tokioschool/"},"degree_name":"Desarrollador de videojuegos con Unity","field_of_study":null,"grade":null},{"date":{"start":{"month":10,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":1,"day":null,"year":2023}},"school":{"name":"Generation Colombia","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQHAPSdnw-c0Mw/company-logo_400_400/0/1688478594111/generation_colombia_logo?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=mBMqw57wCSqDo0L622P0Co7c7OLEwU9O4QM6NpedF5g","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/generation-colombia/"},"degree_name":"Jr Unity Developer","field_of_study":"Game developer","grade":null}],"languages":{"primary_locale":{"country":"ES","language":"es"},"supported_locales":[{"country":"ES","language":"es"}],"profile_languages":[]},"current_job_year":null,"current_job_month":null,"picture":"https://assets-prospeo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lead_5IKPWZRMF7MZ8AFPLNA1.jpg","email":{"email":null,"email_anon_id":null,"email_status":"NOT_FOUND","email_type":"professional"},"company":{"name":null},"location":{"country":"Colombia","country_code":"CO","state":null,"city":"Bogota","timezone":"America/Bogota","timezone_offset":"-5.0","postal_code":null,"raw":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia"}}}}
