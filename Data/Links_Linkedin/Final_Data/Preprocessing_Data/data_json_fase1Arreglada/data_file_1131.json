Curiosity is the fuel that moves me. It motivates me to innovate, to improve processes, to come up with new proposals, to seek new solutions, and without a doubt, to live with passion. Finding connections on seemingly unrelated issues and apply them in my day-to-day life as an engineer and as a citizen makes me happy.\n\nI studied chemical engineering and a master's degree in mechanical engineering. I specialized in the development and study of polymeric materials and bioprocesses. I have designed for the industry bioactive materials based on recycled thermoplastic polymers, flexible polyurethane foams with improved mechanical properties, formulations for the production of beers with local raw materials, biodigesters for agricultural applications, and I have even experimented in the development of biomaterials to starting from fungal hyphae.\n\nMy abilities:\n\u231d Design of experiments.\n\u231d Optimization of processes.\n\u231d Biomimicry.\n\u231d Technological surveillance.\n\u231d Programming in Python, Matlab, and VGA.\n\u231d Modeling and simulation of processes.\n\u231d Advanced Excel.\n\u231d Image analysis.\n\u231d Reengineering.\n\u231d Root cause analysis.\n\u231d 3D printing.\n\u231d Handling of instruments in chemical and biological laboratories.\n\nI am a fan of collaborative and citizen science production. I love initiatives like beekeeping or urban agriculture, as well as exploring the stars and local nature. Platforms such as INaturalist, eBird, MO Free, and YouTube have been a great help in this process of discovery with the community. \u200bEven though, my interests go beyond science and technology. I enjoy drawing, painting, sculpting, taking photographs, writing, and, in short, I like working with diverse communities, as after all, art, science, and technology are made by people and for people.\n\nIf you found what you read here interesting and do you want to contact me, do not hesitate to send me an e-mail at xavargasa@gmail.com .\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/xavargasa/","premium":false,"skills":"Aseguramiento de la calidad, Microsoft Office, AutoCAD, An\u00e1lisis de datos, Agricultura sostenible, Gesti\u00f3n de proyectos, Gesti\u00f3n energ\u00e9tica, Biotecnolog\u00eda, Pol\u00edmeros, Simulaci\u00f3n de procesos, Dise\u00f1o de procesos, Liderazgo, Microsoft Word","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":12088,"name":"Mabe Global","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQGkFzwt8nBC5w/company-logo_400_400/0/1664677305616?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=2cEc791IsT6HGOhv627jvfl29CTVWLKYPP2WmCsYTh4","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/mabe/","employees":{"start":10001,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Per\u00edmetro Urbano Manizales, Caldas, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2022},"end":{"month":8,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"Mabe Global","description":null,"title":"Laboratory Chemical Engineer","employment_type":"Full-time"}]},{"company":{"id":36221910,"name":"Espumatec Colombia S.C.S.","logo":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEwvvlz4zVtvg/company-logo_400_400/0/1592011408393?e=1705536000&v=beta&t=U7Edks4TMAqgN0shdTPY_i5-EEo9DkT4QvghdXiaY0U","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/espumatec-colombia-s.c.s./","employees":{"start":2,"end":10}},"date":{"start":{"month":3,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2022}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Bogot\u00e1, Distrito Capital, Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":3,"day":null,"year":2016},"end":{"month":4,"day":null,"year":2022}},"company":"Espumatec Colombia S.C.S.","description":"I lead the renovation of the Company.
