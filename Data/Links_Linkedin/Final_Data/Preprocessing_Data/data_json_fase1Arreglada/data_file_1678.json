Fire Engineering Limited formally replaced Astute Fire (South) Limited in 2022, with the Astute Fire name continuing to be used in Scotland.\n    \nSemper provides Fire Engineering consultancy services to the construction industry. Our business structure is based on well-integrated experts in Engineering, Research, and Surveying \u2013 striving to deliver value at all stages of a project, from concept design to construction and the operational life of a building. Collectively, we cover a range of skills and backgrounds, well placed to deliver Fire Safety Strategies which satisfy the intent and spirit of buildings\u2019 functional requirements and objectives.\n   \nSemper approaches fire engineering by placing the fire safety strategy at the centre of our work \u2013 understanding and helping stakeholders recognise how the building\u2019s features will as a whole respond in the event of a fire. Our engineers are well versed in fire engineering design, computational modelling (fire-smoke behaviour, fire structure interaction, human evacuation), risk analysis and management, as well as probabilistic analysis, and, when required, the ability to perform complex calculations derived from first principles.\n   \nOur experts in surveying are essential in ensuring that fire engineering features proposed for budlings are correctly adopted during construction, commissioning, and even years after being used. Moreover, our people keep up to date with the latest advances in fire engineering and building design through their attendance at training sessions, workshops, and conferences around the world.\n   ","total_emails":4,"location":{"country":"United Kingdom","country_code":"GB","state":null,"city":"London","timezone":"Europe/London","timezone_offset":"1.0","postal_code":null,"address":"20 Farringdon Street"}},"location":{"country":"United Kingdom","country_code":"GB","state":"England","city":"London","timezone":"Europe/London","timezone_offset":1.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"London, England, United Kingdom"}}}}
