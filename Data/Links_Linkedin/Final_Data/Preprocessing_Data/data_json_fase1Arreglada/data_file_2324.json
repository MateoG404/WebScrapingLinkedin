Alongside our import offices in Australia, Europe, North America, and Taiwan, Caravela is dedicated to bridging the gap between specialty coffee roasters and smallholder coffee farmers, focused on quality, transparency and long-term sustainable relationships.\n\nCaravela has been a B-Corp certified company since 2014 and has been named by B-Labs a Best-for-the-World company the last six years.\n\nWe operate almost 40 cupping labs, often in remote locations, where highly trained quality analysts identify and purchase individual deliveries direct from producers at above average market premiums and where exceptional quality is incentivised with constant technical assistance and experimentation.\n\nQuality is the Cornerstone: We believe in keeping outstanding coffees separate, to recognize the farmers who go the extra mile to produce amazing coffee.  Every year our QC Analysts cup over 20,000 samples from more than 4,000 individual coffee producers and cooperatives, providing individual feedback to every single farmer.","total_emails":90,"location":{"country":"United Kingdom","country_code":"GB","state":null,"city":"London","timezone":"Europe/London","timezone_offset":"1.0","postal_code":null,"address":"44-48 Wharf Road"}},"location":{"country":"Colombia","country_code":"CO","state":null,"city":"Bogota","timezone":"America/Bogota","timezone_offset":-5.0,"postal_code":null,"raw":"Bogota, D.C., Capital District, Colombia"}}}}
