At Capacitor Foundry, we raised over half a million dollars to test disruptive concepts in electrochemical energy storage ranging from capacitors, to batteries and electrochemical carbon capture.\n\nAs a social entrepreneur, I co-created and lead DeVolver ConCiencia, an initiative that aims to inspire Colombians in low-income parts of the country to dream big. We do it by interviewing Colombians around the world in all fields of knowledge and sharing their dreams and challenges with our audience through radio, television, and virtual events with schools.\n\nI have also been a leadership coach since 2018 and I love seeing people grow. I have a passion for working in multicultural teams, developing healthy team dynamics, and navigating conflict.","premium":false,"skills":"Liderazgo de equipos, Participaci\u00f3n de las partes interesadas, Diversidad e inclusi\u00f3n, Gesti\u00f3n del tiempo, Nanomateriales, Hablar en p\u00fablico, Python, Recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos corporativos, Relaci\u00f3n con el cliente, Gesti\u00f3n de proyectos, analisis de datos, Electroqu\u00edmica, Matlab, Research, Physics, Programming, Science, English, Microsoft Office, Statistics","work_experience":[{"company":{"id":null,"name":"Fundaci\u00f3n Buenaventura Biling\u00fce","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":null,"date":{"start":{"month":7,"day":null,"year":2023},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"Fundaci\u00f3n Buenaventura Biling\u00fce","description":null,"title":"Enlace internacional de proyectos ","employment_type":null}]},{"company":{"id":null,"name":"DeVolver ConCiencia","logo":null,"url":null,"employees":{"start":null,"end":null}},"date":{"start":{"month":2,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"profile_positions":[{"location":"Colombia","date":{"start":{"month":2,"day":null,"year":2021},"end":{"month":null,"day":null,"year":null}},"company":"DeVolver ConCiencia","description":"Lead of a team of 10 Colombian professionals in all fields of knowledge who live around the World.
