Since its creation, WasteServ has been committed to promoting waste reduction and recycling, and to establishing and maintaining innovative waste management infrastructure to protect the environment and society. \n\nWe recognise that the linear economy approach, which involves taking resources to make products which are then used and discarded when no longer wanted, is no longer working for businesses, people and the environment. So, we want to be at the forefront of this transformative change towards a circular economy approach. This means that we are continually evaluating our operations to create value from previously wasted energy and materials. \n\nWasteServ will soon be home to Malta\u2019s largest ever investment in the waste management sector, ECOHIVE, that will drive Malta towards a circular economy. WasteServ is determined to act in the most sustainable and resource-efficient way possible, by turning waste into good quality recyclable materials. In the meantime, we will continue working to make sure that recyclable items are separated into different waste streams to be recycled and returned into the economic cycle. \n\nOur Mission\n\nTo lead Malta\u2019s waste management facilities and services towards a circular economy approach.
